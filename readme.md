# Laser-cut cardboard bookshelf

Here are the instructions to print a small (67 x 77 x 24 cm) bookshelf made out of cardboard. It is designed to use an EpilogLaser Fusion Pro with table dimensions 812 x 508 mm (like the one available at the [Quebec National Library in Montreal](https://square.banq.qc.ca/)) and 3 mm-thick corrugated cardboard. No glue required.

I haven't tested how strong it is, but it is sturdy enough to hold most things you would want to put on a regular shelf. Also, the design is potentially stackable, so you could add at least two more levels on top. I have yet to test this too.

## Instructions

### Selecting the materials
Ideally you should reuse cardborad boxes as long as they are in good conditions, most importantly that they are still reasonably flat. You can keep boxes from old packages as long as you did not damage them too much to open them (I'd suggest using a box cutter instead of your bare hands).
You'll want to cut **9** sheets of 32 x 20 inches (812 x 508 mm). For example, if you got an [Ikea Songesand wardrobe](https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/songesand-wardrobe-white-10394558/) you can get 16 cardboard sheets out of the package.

The flutes on the cardboard should run paralel to the short side of the sheet, at least for the weight-supporting parts (Shelf\_A.svg & Shelf\_C.svg). The horizontal levels are made with a double layer, where the flutes on one layer run perpendicular to the other. In order to do that, **2** of your 9 sheets should have the flutes running parallel to the long side of the surface.

### Printing
'Printing_guide.txt' indicates how many copies of each file you need, and in which orientation, for the basic 3x2 design.

I used the recommended setting for cutting cardboard (30% speed, 40% power, 50% frequency) on the black lines. The red lines on files A and C are just meant to be folded. I printed them on the cutting settings, at 70% speed, 20% power, 50% frequency.

### Assembly
'Assembly_guide.svg' shows where each piece should go in the final product. I'd recommend following this order:
1. Fold both copies of A, place side by side, and insert horizontal levels of Ba + Bb, one layer at a time. I put the layer with the flutes running along the long side on the bottom at each level.
2. Turn upside down, attach support base beams (Ba). If you really want them to lock in place, you could use glue, but I don't think that's necessary if you don't plan to move your shelf too much.
3. Turn right side up again. 
4. Fold both copies of C and lock them *inside* the square formed by A.
5. Insert the horizontal levels of D. Again, long-running flutes on the bottom. The bottom level should be resting perfectly on top of A.

That's it! you made a shelf out of trash!

### Extras
If you wanted to add two more levels, you could print two more copies of A, and one copy in each orientation of Bb, and place it on top of the whole thing. I haven't tested how steady this will be though.

You can also make drawers if you wanted to keep some compartments protected from dust. The upper levels can fit a box that's 24 x 23 x 21 cm (d w h). I'll add a file to print one as well, as soon as I find a good design for a no-glue box.
